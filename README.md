- âš¡ Fun facts: The consummate 'Jack-of-all-trades', I suck at lots of things. Even the realm in which I truly excel has a hard-capped, sub-60% success rate. Bluster be damned, the overwhelming majority will never sniff 40%. I'll bet you can't guess what it is! But don't cry for me, Argentina National Team...I retired <40yo. THANKS, OBAM...I mean, BITCOIN!!1
