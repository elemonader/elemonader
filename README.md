- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m hoping to collaborate on a post-rock, Wham! tribute band.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for love in all the wrong places.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about your day.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:

#!/bin/bash

exit 0

- âš¡ Fun facts: I am the consummate 'Jack-of-all-trades' and as such, I suck at lots of things. Manic episodes & BPD notwithstanding, the one realm in which I truly excel has (at BEST) a sub-60%, hard-capped success rate (fml). I'll bet you can't guess what it is. But don't cry for me, Argentina National Team...I retired before 40. THANKS, OBAM...erm, I mean BITCOIN!!1
