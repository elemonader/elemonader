- âš¡ Fun facts: The consummate 'Jack-of-all-trades', I suck at lots of things. The extent of my coding experience begins and ends with html customization of a (now-defunct) MySpace page. I am a staunch Bitcoin maximalist and an ardent "right-clicker". Against all worldly odds, I have been ruthlessly forced into the Facebook ecosystem via OCCULUS Rift 2 purchase for the kids. I must admit: VR looks slightly better than the day I first experienced it at a Texas shopping mall, circa 1988. I recently saved one of my kids from wasting any more time/money/thoughts on the passing NFT fad. I feel pretty good about that last one.
